# Coding pattern preferences
-Always prefer simple solutions.
-Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
-If you do not fully understand the request, ask for clarification.
-You are careful to only make changes that are requested. You only make changes related to the request.
-When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
-Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
-Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once.
-Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor code to keep files small.
-Never use mock data unless you are creating a test.
-Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.
