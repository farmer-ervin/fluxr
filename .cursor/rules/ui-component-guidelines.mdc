# Component Selection & Styling Guidelines

## Component Hierarchy
1. **shadcn/ui Components**: Always use shadcn/ui components as the first choice.
   - Install via `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]`
   - Use the built-in variants and customize with props before adding custom styles

2. **Radix UI Components**: If no shadcn/ui equivalent exists, use Radix UI.
   - Style using the global styling rules to maintain consistency

3. **Third-Party Components**: When needed and specifically requested.
   - When installing third-party components, style them using our global styling rules
   - Make them visually consistent with our shadcn/ui components
   - Compose from existing primitive components when possible
   - Follow the same naming conventions and file structure as shadcn/ui

## Styling Resources
1. **Global Styles**: Reference both configuration files:
   - `index.css`: Contains CSS variables, utility classes, and component-specific styles
   - `tailwind.config.js`: Contains theme extensions, custom colors, animations, and plugins
   
2. **Using Tailwind Config**:
   - Use extended theme values from `tailwind.config.js` for consistent styling
   - Reference custom colors like `bg-primary.opacity-5` or `shadow-blue-glow`
   - Utilize the custom transitions, animations, and font settings

3. **Component Styling Strategy**:
   - First: Use Tailwind classes directly
   - Second: Use utility classes from `index.css`
   - Third: Add minimal custom CSS when absolutely necessary

## Implementation Rules
1. **Component Composition**:
   - Compose new components from existing primitives when possible
   - Follow the same directory structure and naming conventions as shadcn/ui
   - Create variants using the same pattern as shadcn/ui components

2. **Third-Party Integration**: 
   - When instructed to use a specific third-party component, install as directed
   - Apply our global styling rules to make it visually consistent
   - Use theme values from both `tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`

3. **Consistency Principle**:
   - All components, regardless of source, should look like they belong to the same design system
   - Match the visual language (colors, shadows, animations) defined in our configuration files
